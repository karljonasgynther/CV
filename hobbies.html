  <h2>Diving</h2>
  <p>I started diving when I was 13 years old, getting my <a href="https://www.padi.com/"><strong>PADI</strong></a> Junior Open Water certificate.
  </p> I quickly got into more advanced diving and took my Advanced Open Water certificate at the age of 15 and then my Rescue Diver certificate at the age of 16.
  After that I had a quite long break from more dive courses as I'd already come about as far as you can without going professional.
  The next step was when I took my Dive Master certification 2019, so after roughly 20 years as a diver.
  I usually go diving in the Tomini Gulf that lies around where I live, but I have had extensive experience as a diver in cold climate as well.
  Nowadays, thanks to my interest in Spearfishing I do about 150 dives every year together with my friends.
